<h1 align="center">Hello world 👋</h1>

### About me 💻🤓 
I am a passionate bioinformatician who loves working with various -omics data (genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, and interactomes) to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind complex traits, specifically drug-response phenotypes, aging, and age-associated diseases. 

### Current position 
- Bioinformatician & Postdoctoral Research Associate @ Université Paris Cité - CNRS UMR7592 / Institut Jacques Monod (Paris, FRANCE)
- Project in collaboration with
  - Michael Rera, PhD (<a href='https://michaelrera.github.io/'>Website</a>) [CNRS] (PI/Advisor)
  - Marc Santolini, PhD (<a href='https://interactiondatalab.com/'>Website</a>) [Learning Planet Institute] (Network Science Collaborator)

_________

### Education
- PhD candidate in Bioinformatics @ Université de Montréal (Montréal, CANADA)
- Supervision by 
  - Adrian Serohijos, PhD (<a href='http://www.serohijoslab.org/'>Website</a>) [Université de Montréal]
  - Julie Hussin, PhD (<a href='https://mhi-omics.org/'>Website</a>) [Université de Montréal]
